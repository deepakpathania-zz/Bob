#Bob
- A chrome extension that allows hands free web navigation with options like new tab, search, click, scroll and close tab.

# How to get started

1. Clone this repository to yoir local machine.
2. In Google Chrome, open up your extensions page located at chrome://extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode by ticking the checkbox.
4. Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the Bob folder which you just cloned as the directory.
5. If this is your first time using Bob, we have to first enable Bob to get access to your microphone
  * First, right click Bob's extension icon and click "Options". You can also get to this page by clicking "Options" on the extension page
  * You should see Bob request access to your microphone. Give him access!
6. Open a new page (say [Google](http://google.com)) and click on Bob's extension icon located on the right side of the navigation bar.
7. Say "Bob" and wait for a ding sound.
8. You're good to go! Try something like "look up facebook" and enjoy Bob.
9. Right now, Bob gets disabled with a whoosh sound after 10 second of inactivity so that your normal sound doesn't get treated as commands when you are not talking to it. Enable it again by saying "Bob".

  * Scrolling (scroll up, scroll down, stop)
  * New tab
  * Close tab
  * Go back
